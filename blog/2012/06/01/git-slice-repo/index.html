<p>I maintain my personal scripts (only a few by now) on a
<a href="github.com/jvrsantacruz/scripts">public repository</a> on GitHub, so it forces myself to take them more
seriously and keep it clean. It looked like a good idea back then, because all I&rsquo;ve got were just
not enough for a repo on its own. So I kept them together in separate directories under the same
repo this way:</p>

<pre><code>scripts
 |- README.md
 |- project1
 |   `- script1.py
 `- project2
     `- script2.py
</code></pre>

<p>And each commit in the repo clarifies which project modifies by preceding it with a <em>code</em> this way:</p>

<pre><code>d65bf0e project1: Adds test_rotate function to test rotate verb
2943d69 project1: Removes unused TestFileOperations.newfile
..
dc37490 project2: Rewrites comments
9d00b0a project2: Fixes output-based tests redirecting stderr
</code></pre>

<p>But as some of them are now well grown up, like <code>backup.py</code>, I thought they deserved more
visibility and wanted those specific directories out into a new repo&hellip; but keeping the history with
them, and without the commit message <em>code</em> boilerplate.</p>

<p>There is one easy obvious way to to this, by <em>(1)</em> cloning the repository, then <em>(2)</em> using <code>git
filter-branch</code> to remove the undesired directories and <em>(3)</em> to rewrite commits messages
afterwards.</p>

<pre><code># 1: Clone repository
$ git clone --no-hardlinks /original-repo /new-repo

# 2: Filter away undesired stuff
$ git filter-branch --tree-filter "rm -rf project2" --prune-empty HEAD

# 3: Filter 'project1:' code from commits messages
$ git filter-branch --msg-filter "sed 's/project1: //' --prune-empty HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>--prune-empty</code> option makes git to discard commits that become empty after the filter and
therefore are now useless.</p>

<p>You can se the difference from the original repo and the <a href="github.com/jvrsantacruz/backup">new one</a> for <code>backup</code>.</p>
